# Edge-Utils

Edge-Utils is a powerful, lightweight library designed specifically for edge computing environments. It provides a comprehensive suite of utilities that help developers build fast, secure, and scalable applications at the edge.

## What is Edge Computing?

Edge computing brings computation and data storage closer to the location where it's needed, reducing latency and bandwidth usage. Platforms like Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge Functions, and Deno Deploy enable developers to run code at the edge of the network.

## Why Edge-Utils?

- **Performance Optimized**: Built specifically for edge environments with minimal bundle size
- **Platform Agnostic**: Works across Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge, Deno Deploy, and more
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive error handling, logging, and monitoring
- **Type Safe**: Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions
- **Well Tested**: Extensive test coverage ensuring reliability
- **Developer Friendly**: Intuitive APIs with excellent documentation

## Key Features

### Core Utilities
- **GraphQL Client**: Efficient GraphQL operations with caching and error handling
- **WebSocket Manager**: Real-time communication with connection pooling
- **Authentication**: JWT, API keys, and session management
- **Caching**: Multiple backends with advanced caching strategies

### Edge-Optimized Features
- **Performance Monitoring**: Cold start detection and streaming responses
- **Geographic Utilities**: Location detection and nearest endpoint routing
- **Load Balancing**: Intelligent distribution across multiple endpoints
- **Rate Limiting**: Flexible algorithms with DDoS protection

### Security & Reliability
- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive security header management
- **Content Negotiation**: Smart content type detection and formatting
- **Monitoring**: Structured logging and distributed tracing
- **Error Handling**: Robust error management with proper cleanup

## Quick Example

```js
import { GraphQLClient, CacheManager, WebSocketManager } from 'edge-utils';

// GraphQL with caching
const client = new GraphQLClient('https://api.example.com/graphql', {
  cache: new CacheManager({ ttl: 300000 })
});

const data = await client.query(`
  query GetUser($id: ID!) {
    user(id: $id) {
      name
      email
    }
  }
`, { id: '123' });

// WebSocket real-time communication
const wsManager = new WebSocketManager({
  maxConnections: 1000,
  heartbeatInterval: 30000
});

// Authentication middleware
const auth = new AuthManager({
  jwtSecret: 'your-secret',
  apiKeys: ['key1', 'key2']
});
```

## Supported Platforms

Edge-Utils works seamlessly across all major edge platforms:

- **Cloudflare Workers**: Full compatibility with Workers runtime
- **Vercel Edge Functions**: Optimized for Vercel's edge network
- **Deno Deploy**: Native support for Deno's Web APIs
- **Node.js**: Compatible with Node.js edge runtimes
- **Browser**: Works in modern browsers with Web API support
